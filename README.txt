This plugin let's you configure a way of shortening too long titles.

== Description ==

I developed this plugin to meet my own needs. I use the Intagrate Lite plugin to fetch Instagram posts and publish them as
WordPress posts on my blog. However, the text of the Instagram post becomes the title of the WordPress post,
and many times the title is too long.

With this plugin, you may configure a max length of the title, and also specific characters to look for as the 
end of a sentece. I also added a setting to only include specific categories.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `crs-post-title-shortener` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin to match your needs
